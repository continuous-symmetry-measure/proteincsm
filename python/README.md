# CSM

## Introduction

The Protein CSM (Continuous Symmetry Measure) program allows users to measure the continuous symmetry of homomer proteins.

## Features


 * The hungarian algorithm for approximating the continuous symmetry measure of a homomer Protein CSM
 * The greedy algorithm for approximating the continuous symmetry measure of a homomer Protein CSM
 * The trivial algorithm for approximating the continuous symmetry measure of a homomer Protein CSM

## Usage

After installation, the program can be called from the command line. For example:

`proteincsm c2 inputmol.mol output.txt --optional-args`

You can access a help menu with a list of all available options via `csm -h`

## Installation

Protein CSM can be installed on Windows and Linux machines.

### Requirements
Before installing Protein CSM, you must first install Open Babel (http://openbabel.org/wiki/Category:Installation), 
version 2.4.0 or later.

You must also install Open Babel's python bindings (`pip install openbabel`) and numpy (`pip install numpy`)

### Installation

Protein CSM can be installed using:

`pip install proteincsm`

You can also install Protein CSM from the source.
